Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (First In First Out) 
Principle,FIFO Principle states that the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed or processed.

terminologies:
Front: Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue. It is also referred as the head of the queue.

Rear: Position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear of the queue. It is also referred as the tail of the queue.

operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the end (rear) of the queue. If the queue is full, an overflow error occurs.

Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, an underflow error occurs.


enQueue(): This operation adds a new node after the rear and moves the rear to the next node.
deQueue(): This operation removes the front node and moves the front to the next node.

Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends.
Deque can act as both Stack and Queue
It is useful in many problems where we need to have a subset of all operations also like insert/remove at front and insert/remove at the end.
It is typically implemented either using a doubly linked list or circular array.
